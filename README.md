## 🛠️ How to Use Graph-Greener

   ---
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/priv.git

   cd priv
   ---

3. **Create a file named `data.txt` inside the cloned `priv` folder.**  
   _This file will be modified by the script to generate commits._

4. **Copy the `main.py` script into the `priv` folder.**  
   _You can download `main.py` from this repository or copy it manually._

5. **Run the script:**
   ---
   python main.py
  ---

6. **Follow the on-screen prompts:**  
   - Enter the number of commits you want to generate  
   - Confirm or change the repository path (default is current directory)  
   - Confirm or change the filename to modify (default is `data.txt`)

7. **The script will create backdated commits and push them to your `priv` repository.**

8. **Check your GitHub profile after a few minutes to see your contribution graph fill up with green squares!**
